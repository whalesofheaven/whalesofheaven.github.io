Dear Whales of Heaven,

This is our very first newsletter. Right now, it's just us, Whales of Heaven. And as we start this journey together, I want to share a tweet by Pastor Tim Keller today:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Christian faith that Augustine defended is here today when all its 5th century rivals are long forgotten. And the Christian gospel will be here years from now when all its current cultural rivals are long-gone.</p>&mdash; Timothy Keller (@timkellernyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/timkellernyc/status/1366426965268459528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

We are here to start conversations in search of truth amidst the chaotic political, social, and moral landscape. That truth is Jesus Christ. In <a href="https://esv.org/Matthew14:22" target="_blank">Matthew 14</a>, Peter saw the wind, was afraid, and began to sink into the water. But what was steady was Jesus Christ. In the same way, we may feel confused and overwhelmed by today's winds. But Jesus Christ is forever. So let us come together to search for and hold on to what is forever.

<blockquote class="quotes">
  But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    - Matthew 6:20 ESV
  </div>
</blockquote>

God bless,

Harang
