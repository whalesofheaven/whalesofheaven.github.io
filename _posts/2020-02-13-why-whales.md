What is Whales of Heaven? We are four brothers in Christ in Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

As we gathered to hang out and share our lives in the world and in faith, we found lacking discussions in our community about how to take a Biblical approach to difficult questions that we encounter in current events and in our daily lives. We are no pastors or experts on theology, economics, politics, or culture, but we hope to start a discussion about how we can try to understand those difficult questions from a Biblical perspective. This is us taking action to build something for the kingdom of God and for His glory. We hope that you support us in prayer. Please reach out to us for any comments or questions <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact.html">here</a>.

  But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

What's in the name "Whales of Heaven"? In the crypto community, a whale is a holder of a large amount of crypto assets, such as bitcoin. Sadly, none of us are whales. But we console and encourage each other that we are "whales of heaven" who stack and hodl treasures in heaven.
