"Do you believe in God?" is a question that both Christians and non-Christians ask each other alike. Having been asked that question and having seen that question asked to others, I know that it can be a difficult question to answer. It can be even more difficult for people who are just coming to faith but no less important for long-time Christians. And it is difficult because we see ourselves sometimes acting in ways that contradict the belief in God. That is, if I *really* believed in God, would I have done that thing that I am terribly ashamed of?

<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">  
  What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?... Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works
  <div style="text-align: right;">James 2:14,21-22 ESV</div>

Perhaps a more reasonable answer to the question is not black-and-white, yes-or-no, faith-or-no-faith. For new and "older" Christians alike (and even for non-Christians), it may be more useful and closer to the truth to think about **belief as a spectrum, one that shapes your actions**. For newer Christians, this perspective acknowledges that they can have faith, however small, that they can grow. For "older" Christians, it motivates them to manifest their faith in their actions and grow their faith even further. And for non-Christians, perhaps this perspective motivates them to think about the latent beliefs that guide their own actions.

In [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKG4_psaC9k) to the question of whether he believes in God, the clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson said, "I act as if God exists." Peterson distills "believing" into acting in accordance to belief. Peterson adapts the idea from Friedrich Nietzsche who said that "there has been only one Christian, and he died on the cross." That is, the only person to ever live in perfect accordance with his faith was Jesus himself. We only try, and inevitably fail, to live as Jesus did.

<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
  He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me." Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
  <div style="text-align: right;">Matthew 14:29-31 ESV</div>

Whether or not you agree with either Peterson or Nietzsche, they highlight an important part of belief; that is acting in accordance to that belief. Indeed, belief is the thing that determines how you act. For example, when you sit down in a chair, you believe that there is a chair where you will sit, and according to that belief, you sit. But sometimes, a prankster friend can pull out the chair as you are sitting, and you, in the belief that the chair is still under you, will try to sit and fall on the floor, to the hilarity of your friend. While there was a chair in one case but not in the other, you believed that there was a chair in both cases, and you acted accordingly.

Belief shapes action in all areas of life, from things as menial as sitting on chairs to things as serious as martyrdom. Personally, I found that financial investment is an example that nicely illustrates how belief shapes actions. After a bit over a year of learning about financial and crypto assets and investing in them, I found that I can only stay in a trade if I believe in the asset. If I don't believe in the asset, I end up selling when the price dips, and I can't wait for the price to appreciate again. Those who have made some investments may empathize. When the price dips and you believe in the asset, it's a sale, and I buy more; when the price dips and you don't believe in the asset, it's a crash, and I sell. My belief or lack thereof in an asset shapes my reaction to price changes.

  He said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."

So, if faith shapes your actions, what then? The takeaways from this essay may be two-fold. First, manifest your faith in your actions. If you say you believe in something, what are you doing to live out that belief? And second, test your faith in your actions. Consider your actions. What do they tell you about your beliefs?
